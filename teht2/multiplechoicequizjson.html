    <!--Make a single page multiple choice quiz app using JavaScript and JSON. There should be at least 3 different multiple 
        choice questions and they should be stored in a separate JSON file called questions.json. 
        The main page uses AJAJ (AJAX) call to fetch JSON file from the same web server and 
        uses it to build a web page with a mobile friendly user interface. After the user presses a button the JavaScript 
        code will first verify if the user has replied all the questions, then it will display how many questions the user got correct.

        Tip: You need a web server to make this work. In other words trying to load JSON file from local file system is going to fail. 
        If you choose to use normal .js file instead, you will not get full points from this assignment. 

        You can use either fetch API or jQuery $.getJSON(url) to fetch the JSON data from specified URL. 
        jQuery can also be useful to find the radio buttons the user has clicked, but you can complete the assignment 
        without using jQuery at all.

        Use Bootstrap or similar library to make the web page responsive (mobile friendly).-->
